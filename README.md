This repository contains some files we are using in the course project we performed for ME604 - Robotics, as part of which we are building a SCARA (RRP) robotic arm for the purpose of picking and sorting objects of various shapes. We are performing this in Spring 2019. Files are being uploaded progressively as and when they are created and finalized upon. SLDPRT is the extension for SolidWorks 2014 x64 version Part models and SLDASM is the extension for SolidWorks 2014 x64 version Assembly models.
