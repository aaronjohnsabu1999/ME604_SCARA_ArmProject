# The SCARA Arm

This repository contains files pertaining to the construction of a shape-based pick-and-sort SCARA (RRP) robotic arm, built as part of the course project of ME604 (Robotics) in Spring 2019.  
`SLDPRT` files are *part* files opened using SolidWorks (here, SolidWords 2014 x64). Similarly `SLDASM` files are *assembly* files opened using the same software.
